# Controllability of Financial Networks - Applying Control Theory to the FinancialRiskMeter

This is my final project for the seminar Network Games and Mechanism Design for the [Thematic Einstein Semester of the MATH+ Excellence Cluster](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/combi/dmg/TES-Summer2019/index.html) and is to be presented [at the final workshop](https://www3.math.tu-berlin.de/combi/dmg/TES-Summer2019/final_workshop.html). I apply the concept of controllability of a graph to a complex network of financial instituitions and compute the Minimum Input/Driver Node Set.

This repository contains:
- Two adjacency matrices from the FRM (data/)
- [A jupyter script with all the code](https://github.com/ANGELMAN-J/Network-Games-and-Mechanism-Design-SS19/blob/master/Controllability%20of%20Financial%20Networks%20-%20Minimum%20Input%20Set.ipynb)
- Plot outputs
- [PDF of the slides for my presentation](https://github.com/ANGELMAN-J/Network-Games-and-Mechanism-Design-SS19/blob/master/20190628%20Network%20Games%20and%20Mechanism%20Design.pdf)
